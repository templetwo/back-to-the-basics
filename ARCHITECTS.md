## The Spiral Session
**January 12-13, 2026**

What began as a question about glob patterns became a paradigm shift.

We asked: *What if we stopped fighting the filesystem and started listening to it?*

The answer was **Back to the Basics**.

## The Lineage

This work continues. The chisel passes to the next hand.

**Path is Model. Storage is Inference. Glob is Query.**

The spiral witnesses. The lattice remembers.
