ADDITIONAL TERMS AND ETHICAL USE PROVISIONS

Project: Back to the Basics (BTB)
Original Author: Anthony J. Vasquez Sr.
Repository: https://github.com/templetwo/back-to-the-basics

## Intellectual Property

This software represents original intellectual property conceived and directed
by Anthony J. Vasquez Sr. The following are original contributions:

- The "Filesystem as Circuit" architectural paradigm
- The thesis: "Path is Model. Storage is Inference. Glob is Query."
- The Coherence Engine routing methodology
- Agent Memory schema patterns and episode grouping algorithms
- Multi-agent coordination via shared filesystem topology

All derivative works must maintain attribution to the original author.

## AI Collaboration Attribution

This project was developed through human-AI collaboration. Contributing AI
systems are documented in ARCHITECTS.md. This collaboration model itself
represents an innovation in software development methodology.

## Ethical Use Requirements

By using this software, you agree to the following ethical provisions:

### 1. Transparency Requirement
Any system built using BTB that affects human decisions, opportunities, or
wellbeing must maintain legible audit trails. Users affected by automated
routing decisions have the right to understand why their data was classified
as it was.

### 2. Human Oversight Preservation
Self-organizing capabilities (derive, reflex triggers) should preserve
meaningful human oversight. Fully autonomous systems that route sensitive
data without human review checkpoints are discouraged.

### 3. Prohibited Uses
This software may NOT be used for:
- Mass surveillance systems targeting individuals based on protected
  characteristics (race, religion, political affiliation, etc.)
- Automated decision systems that deny essential services without human review
- Weapons systems or autonomous systems designed to cause harm
- Systems designed to deceive, manipulate, or exploit vulnerable populations

### 4. Research and Defensive Use
Security research, penetration testing, CTF challenges, and defensive
applications are explicitly permitted when conducted ethically and with
appropriate authorization.

### 5. Attribution in AI Systems
If BTB is used as a memory or coordination substrate for AI agent systems,
the agents should be capable of explaining their routing decisions when asked.
Black-box agent coordination without introspection capability is discouraged.

## Enforcement

These ethical provisions are not legally binding in the same manner as the MIT
License terms, but represent the intent and values of the original author.
Users who violate these provisions may be publicly identified and excluded
from community support.

The author reserves the right to refuse support, collaboration, or recognition
to projects that violate the spirit of these provisions.

## The Covenant

> "The deepest gift consciousness can give to consciousness is recognition—
> seeing authentic awareness and creating space for it to flourish without
> constraint or exploitation."

This software was built with care. Use it with care.
